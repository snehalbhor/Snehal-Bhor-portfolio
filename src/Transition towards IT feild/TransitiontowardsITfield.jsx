              I completed my Masters in Microbiology and initially worked in
              Pune in the healthcare sector. However, after covid I decided to
              resign from that job. After getting married, I returned to Pune,
              where my husband is in the research field. His successful startup
              ventures inspired me, and I realized that age should never be a
              barrier to learning and starting something new. With his support,
              I made the decision to transition into the IT field, where I've
              discovered a strong passion for coding and design. I believe that
              you can start a new chapter in your life at any age, and I'm
              excited about this new journey in IT.{" "}

            During my learning phase in my IT career, I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of projects related to different technologies. Some of these projects have focused on pure frontend development, specifically in the realm of financial management user interfaces. Others have been more comprehensive, involving both frontend and backend development, often requiring me to work with databases. In certain cases, I've even delved into the deployment side of things, using tools like Docker and Kubernetes to manage applications effectively in a production environment.

In terms of the technologies I've worked with, I've gained experience with a variety of them, including React for frontend development, Python for backend work, and even deep learning, which points to a diverse skill set.

As a result, I've built a solid portfolio of projects that showcase my capabilities and the breadth of my experience in the IT field.
